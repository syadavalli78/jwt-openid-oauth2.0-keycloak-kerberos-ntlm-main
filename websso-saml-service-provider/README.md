# WebSSO Service Provider - A SAML 2.0 based WebSSO service provider with Spring Boot and Security

## Description
This spring based java project has been written to create a WebSSO Service Provider to integrate with any IDPs (single or multiple) for authentication purpose. This is generic service provider which can be integrated with any IDP (one or more) and provides features like parsing SMAL 2.0 based token and set authorities using Spring Security and redirect to the application URL (configured in yaml file as application home page for the logged in user).


## Use Case
This project can be used as Service Provider for any IDP for SAML token based authentication.

## Technology Stack
- Java 8 or later
- Spring boot 2.x
- Maven as build tool

## Build
Maven has been used as build tool for this project with default Spring boot build plugin.
Hence, we can use below maven code to build the runnable spring boot jar:

```
mvn clean package
```

## Deployment 
This project is developed with Spring Boot and it return runnable binary and be executed in multiple ways. Mostly it is executed as:

```
java -jar <jar file name>
```

## Configuration

Create private key to expose SP on SSL:
```
src/main/resources/saml/keystore.jks
```

Also add the idP certificate in keystore so that SAML token will be validated.

application.yaml Configuartion
```
application:
  # define relay state to redirect the user to configured application once SAML token validated, multiple relay state can be configured with redirection target
  defaultRelayState: application_alpha
  
  # define if it makes direct call
  directcall: false

  # Relay state and target URL mapping
  url:
    application_alpha: ''
    relayState: url
